Gemini suggested the next thing after the template would be to make a finite state machine for a spaceship airlock

where we have an inner and an outer door and only one is allowed to be open at once

when we first press the button it should open the inner and then next button press close it. the button press after this should open the outer door and after this is equivalent to resetting the system

(we dont care about letting an astronaut back into the ship lol)
