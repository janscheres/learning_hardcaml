Now gemini suggested we do a traffic light

it starts green, which lasts for 3 cycles

then goes yellow for one cycle

and finally red for 3 cycles

before it goes back to green (resets)

ignore the below, i think gemini was hallucinating:
the hint gemini gave is that we will need two registers

1 for the current state (colour)

and another for the timer (depth into this colour)

(i think we could just do it with one big timer of the system as a whole but this solution is probably cleaner)
