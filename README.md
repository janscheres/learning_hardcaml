# Learning Hardcaml

this is a repo to show my progress learning Hardcaml with the help of google gemini.

Running any of these consists of just:
`dune exec ./testbench.exe`

Once you have your environment set up (look elsewhere for instructions for this).
My explicitly installed packages from opam:

```
$ opam list --installed --roots --short
hardcaml
hardcaml_waveterm
ocaml
ocaml-base-compiler
ppx_hardcaml
```
